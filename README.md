# Rubinius Builder

A build system with the following features:

* written in C++ and distributed in a single header file;
* processes a directed graph where the edge between any two nodes a, b is a
  function f such that f(a) = b, read as "f produced b from a";
* dependencies between two nodes a, b are described equivalently as dep(a) =
  b, read as "b is derived from a";
* all files generated by the build process either have an input source
  (possibly generated transitively) or a null input, in which case the
  function f(a) = b describes the generation of b, where a is null;
* files that are produced by the build process are distinguished from files
  that statically exist;
* for f(a) = b, where a statically exists, hash(a) is computed and cached and
  the cache is consulted for whether to compute f(a) to (re)create b;
* all input files must be explicitly references, no automatic search is done;
* each f(a) = b is described in a particular context which may include, for
  example, a compiler object, which in turn may describe header paths, compile
  flags, link flags, link libraries, link mode, etc.;
* implicitly parallel utilizing CPUs + 1 workers (overridable by environmental
  variables or command line options);
* intimately aware of C/C++ build requirements but as language agnostic as
  possible.
